== Usage ==

To add content, it's easy as adding post. In your administration, you can see another post types except default post and pages. These are called Pizzas, Beverages and Pasta.

You can add them in a way you're used to add standard post or page. Plus, you can set extra params in custom metaboxes on your edit page.

In order to get new post types (pizza, beverage, pasta) to actually appear on your web, you'll have to either:

1. Place `<?php pizza_loop(); ?>` into a copy of your archive template called archive-wp_pizzeria_pizza.php instead of default loop.
1. Place `<?php beverages_loop(); ?>` into a copy of your archive template called archive-wp_pizzeria_beverage.php instead of default loop.
1. Place `<?php pasta_loop(); ?>` into a copy of your archive template called archive-wp_pizzeria_pasta.php instead of default loop.
1. Place `<?php dessert_loop(); ?>` into a copy of your archive template called archive-wp_pizzeria_dessert.php instead of default loop.

or

1. Place `[pizzas]` shortcode into a page where you'd like to display pizzas.
1. Place `[beverages]` shortcode into a page where you'd like to display beverages.
1. Place `[pasta]` shortcode into a page where you'd like to display pasta.
1. Place `[desserts]` shortcode into a page where you'd like to display desserts.

or

1. Place `[pizzas cat="term-slug"]` shortcode into a page where you'd like to display pizzas only of selected term.
1. Place `[beverages cat="term-slug"]` shortcode into a page where you'd like to display beverages only of selected term.
